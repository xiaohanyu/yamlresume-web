I am super excited to announce that YAMLResume now has a [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume), and you can [run
YAMLResume instantly with docker](https://asciinema.org/a/722057).

## Why Docker?

YAMLResume is a Node.js CLI tool and a
[library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yamlresume/core). Installing YAMLResume
itself is not difficult since it only requires Node.js. In fact, we can even compile it
to a binary and run it directly without installing Node.js.

However, YAMLResume has a mandatory dependency on LaTeX, which brings some new
problems:

- Installing LaTeX takes time; it usually takes about 5–10 minutes to download a
  proper LaTeX distribution and configure it.
- LaTeX is not a single binary program; it is a collection of programs. Some
  users [dislike installing many programs on their
  machines](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/6#issuecomment-2916479009).

Although we already provide a very comprehensive [installation
guide](/docs/installation) covering macOS, Windows, Ubuntu, and RHEL, even with
instructions on installing YAMLResume and LaTeX and making them work together,
the process can still be painful for some users.

Docker is a great solution to these problems: it can package everything into a
single image, making installation and configuration easy.

## How To Use It

A picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a screenshot showing how to use it:

![YAMLResume Docker
Demo](./static/images/yamlresume-docker/yamlresume-docker-demo.svg)

Our [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume) has
everything pre-packaged, including:

- [Node.js](/docs/installation#nodejs)
- [yamlresume CLI](/docs/installation#yamlresume)
- [XeTeX](/docs/installation#xetex)
- [some recommended fonts](/docs/installation#font)

You can create a new resume instantly with the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

Edit `my-resume.yml` accordingly and then build the resume from YAML to PDF:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume build my-resume.yml
```

#### Under the Hood

If you are familiar with docker, you may already know how this works. If not,
here is a quick explanation:

1. `docker run ... yamlresume/yamlresume` - runs a new container from the
   `yamlresume/yamlresume` image. If this image does not exist on your local
   machine, it will pull it from the [docker
   Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume).
2. `--rm` - automatically removes the container when it exits.
3. `-v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume` - mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) into
   the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing the container to access local
   files.
4. `new my-resume.yml` or `build my-resume.yml` - runs the yamlresume CLI
   [new](/docs/cli#new) or [build](/docs/cli#build) sub-command to create or
   build a resume with the filename `my-resume.yml`.

Basically, you can call all of the `yamlresume` [CLI sub-commands](/cli) in this
way—just append the sub-command after `yamlresume/yamlresume` and then follow
the corresponding usage guide.

The `-v` flag is quite important because it mounts the current directory
(`$(pwd)`) into the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing two-way file sync
between the local directory and the container. Without this flag, the build
output artifact will be lost after the container exits.

## Engineering

Building a docker image is not difficult if you know docker a bit. However,
wrapping YAMLResume in docker is not as easy as it sounds. Here are some of the
challenges.

### LaTeX Configuration is Tedious

Installing a workable LaTeX distribution takes time; it usually takes about 5–10
minutes to download and configure a proper LaTeX distribution. In GitHub Action
runners, this process is [even longer—up to 20+
minutes](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/actions/runs/15438395862/job/43450134447).

```docker
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y \
    texlive-xetex \
    texlive-fonts-extra \
    texlive-lang-all \
    fonts-noto-cjk \
    fonts-noto-cjk-extra \
```

We make it a 3-step process to build [yamlresume's docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume):

1. Start from a Node.js image as the base.
2. Install and configure a LaTeX distribution.
3. Install the yamlresume CLI.

As mentioned, step 2 is the most time-consuming part. If we had to start over
every time we needed to update the docker image, it would take 30 minutes to
build the docker image in a github action runner.

To avoid this, we use a multi-stage build to cache the LaTeX distribution, so we
don't need to install it from scratch every time we update the docker image.

Therefore, we created a new
[yamlresume/yamlresume-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume-base),
which is a base image that has Node.js and a LaTeX distribution installed. This
base image is stable and won't be updated too often, and our `yamlresume/yamlresume`
image is built on top of this base image. It only takes 3 minutes to pull down
the `yamlresume/yamlresume-base` image and install the yamlresume CLI on it,
which drastically reduces the iteration time.

### Multi-Platform Support

Another challenge is to support [multi-platform
builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/). As we know,
macOS M1 and later are ARM-based machines. Although they can run docker images
with AMD64 architecture by emulation, the performance is 10x poorer.

Hence, we have to support multi-platform images for `yamlresume/yamlresume`.
Luckily, docker officially provides a detailed guide about how to [build
multi-platform images in github
actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/multi-platform/).

YAMLResume's docker image supports [two
platforms](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume/tags): `linux/amd64`
and `linux/arm64`, which should be sufficient to cover most desktop and server
machines.

Enjoy YAMLResume with docker!
