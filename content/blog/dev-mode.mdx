I am super excited to introduce [YAMLResume
v0.7](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.7.0), a release
focused on enhancing your developer experience (DX). The centerpiece of this
update is the new [`dev` mode](/docs/cli#dev)—a feature that brings a
seamless, real-time development workflow to your resume creation process.

Gone are the days of the tedious edit-save-build cycle. With `dev` mode,
YAMLResume now watches your resume file for changes and automatically rebuilds
the PDF in near real-time. This seemingly simple addition transforms the
experience of crafting a resume into a fluid, interactive, and much more
enjoyable process.

## The Friction of the Old Workflow

Before v0.7, creating a resume with YAMLResume, while powerful, involved a
repetitive, manual process. You would:

1.  Open your `my-resume.yml` file in your favorite text editor.
2.  Make a change—perhaps updating a job description or adding a new skill.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Switch to your terminal.
5.  Run the `yamlresume build my-resume.yml` command.
6.  Wait for the command to finish.
7.  Switch to your PDF viewer and refresh it to see the result.
8.  Notice a small typo or a formatting issue.
9.  Repeat the entire cycle.

This loop, illustrated below, introduced significant friction into the resume
creation process. Each change, no matter how small, required a context switch
and a manual command execution. This constant interruption breaks the creative
flow and slows down the process of refining your resume.

In the world of modern software development, we've become accustomed to tools
that provide instant feedback. Web developers have
[hot-reloading](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/), which
updates the browser automatically as they change the code. This tight feedback
loop is crucial for productivity and is a core tenet of a great developer
experience. We believed that crafting your resume as code should be no
different.

## The Solution: A Seamless Dev Mode

The `yamlresume dev` command eliminates the manual build cycle entirely. You
start it once, and it works quietly in the background, watching for your
changes and rebuilds the resume automatically.

To start the development mode, simply run:

```bash
yamlresume dev my-resume.yml
```

Now, you can open your `my-resume.yml` file and your PDF side-by-side. Every
time you save a change to your YAML file, YAMLResume will automatically detect
it and trigger a rebuild. Your PDF viewer will update moments later, showing you
the latest version of your resume.

The new workflow is significantly simpler and more efficient:

<Mermaid chart={`

  A[Start 'yamlresume dev'] --> B[Edit my-resume.yml];
  B --> C{Save File};
  C --> D{PDF Automatically Rebuilt};
  D --> E{Review Changes in PDF};
  E -- Correction Needed --> B;
  E -- Looks Good --> F[Stop Dev Mode];

  end
`}/>

This instant feedback loop allows you to iterate quickly, experiment with
different phrasing, and perfect the layout of your resume without the constant
context switching. It makes the process feel less like a chore and more like a
creative endeavor.

Here is a live demo of the `dev` mode in action:

## How It Works: A Look Under the Hood

While the `dev` mode is simple to use, there's some interesting technology
working behind the scenes to ensure it's both robust and efficient.

### The File Watcher: `chokidar`

At the heart of the `dev` mode is a file watcher. A naive approach would be to
use Node.js's built-in [`fs.watch`
API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fswatchfilename-options-listener).
However, `fs.watch` has known limitations and inconsistencies across different
operating systems. More importantly, it struggles with certain text editor
behaviors.

For example, editors like Vim use an "atomic save" strategy. When you save a
file, Vim doesn't directly write to the original file. Instead, it writes the
changes to a temporary file (the well-known `.swp` file), then renames that
temporary file to replace the original. This process can confuse basic file
watchers, which might miss the change entirely or trigger multiple events.

To provide a reliable experience, we adopted
**[chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)**, a popular and
battle-tested file-watching library. Chokidar abstracts away the cross-platform
inconsistencies and is specifically designed to handle these tricky editor
behaviors gracefully. We've configured it to wait until a file has finished
writing before triggering a rebuild, ensuring that we don't try to build a
partially saved file.

### Preventing Build Storms: `coalescifn`

What happens if you save the file multiple times in quick succession? A simple
implementation might try to start a new build for every single save event. This
could lead to a "build storm," where multiple build processes are running
concurrently, consuming unnecessary system resources and potentially leading to
race conditions.

To solve this, we wrote and open sourced a clever little utility called
[coalescifn](https://github.com/yamlresume/coalescifn). This utility helps us
**coalesce** multiple calls into one. Here's how it works in the context of
`dev` mode:

1.  When the first file change is detected, we immediately start a build.
2.  If more changes are detected _while that build is running_, we don't start
new builds. We simply make a note that the file has changed again.
3.  Once the initial build is complete, we check if any more changes occurred
during that time.
4.  If there were subsequent changes, we run exactly _one_ more build to ensure
the final PDF reflects the latest version of the file. If there were no new
changes, we do nothing and wait for the next save event.

This strategy ensures that there is only one build running at a time, and it
guarantees that the final build always uses the most recent version of your
resume file. It's an efficient approach that keeps the `dev` mode responsive and
light on system resources.

Here is a diagram illustrating the coalescing logic:

<Mermaid chart={`

  Builder-->>Coalesce: Finish Build #1 (t=3s)
  Coalesce->>Builder: Start Build #2 (with latest file content)
  Builder-->>Coalesce: Finish Build #2 (t=6s)
`}/>

## Advanced Control

The `dev` command also comes with options to give you more control over the
build process, mirroring the flags available on the `build` command.

### Skipping PDF Generation

Sometimes, you might only want to inspect the intermediate LaTeX (`.tex`) file
that YAMLResume generates. This can be useful for debugging or for those who
want to manually tweak the LaTeX code. Generating the PDF is the most
time-consuming part of the build process. If you don't need it, you can tell
`dev` mode to skip it:

```bash
yamlresume dev my-resume.yml --no-pdf
```

With this flag, `dev` mode will still watch for changes and regenerate the
`.tex` file instantly, but it won't run the `xelatex` command. This makes the
rebuild process almost instantaneous.

### Disabling Validation

As of [v0.5](/blog/yamlresume-compiler), YAMLResume includes a powerful schema
validation step that catches potential errors in your resume during building.
While this is incredibly useful for ensuring correctness, there might be times
when you want to temporarily disable it. For example, you might be in the middle
of a large refactoring of your resume structure and don't want to be interrupted
by validation errors.

You can disable validation with the `--no-validate` flag:

```bash
yamlresume dev my-resume.yml --no-validate
```

This allows you to work more freely, with the understanding that you should
re-enable validation later to ensure your resume is well-formed.

## A New DX for "Resume as Code"

The introduction of `dev` mode is more than just a new feature; it's a step
towards fulfilling the true promise of "Resume as Code." It elevates the
experience from a static, command-line-driven process to a dynamic, interactive
one that feels much more like modern software development.

You might be used to `npm run build` and `npm run dev` in the past? YAMLResume
now has the same workflow built in.

By closing the feedback loop, we're making it easier and faster for you to
create beautiful, professional resumes. We believe this will encourage more
experimentation and allow you to focus on what truly matters: the content of
your resume and how it tells your professional story.

We invite you to update to YAMLResume v0.7 and experience the new `dev` mode for
yourself.
