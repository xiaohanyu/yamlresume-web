We are thrilled to announce the release of [YAMLResume
v0.5](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.5.0), a
significant milestone that transforms YAMLResume from a simple tool into a
full-fledged **resume compiler**. This release introduces a robust
architecture, powerful schema validation, and an enhanced CLI to make your
resume creation process more reliable, efficient, and error-free.

## The Problem with Manual Resume Writing

Drafting a resume is often a tedious and error-prone process. Whether you're
using a word processor or a simple markup language, it's easy to make
mistakes:

- A typo in a key field like `degree` or `fluency`.
- An incorrectly formatted email address or URL.
- Inconsistent date formats.
- Forgetting a required field for a job application.

These small errors can lead to a frustrating cycle of editing, generating, and
proofreading. The core issue is the lack of a system to enforce structure and
validate data _before_ the final document is generated.

## The Solution: A Resume Compiler

Inspired by programming language compilers, [YAMLResume
v0.5](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.5.0) introduces
a new compiler architecture that treats your resume's source file (in YAML) as
code. This "code" is then processed through a pipeline to produce a polished,
professional PDF.

      C[Transformation]
      D[Code Generation]
    end
    subgraph Output
      E[resume.pdf]
    end

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E
"/>

This new architecture defines two core components:

1.  A [standard data format](/docs/compiler/types) for a resume, along with a
    [schema](/docs/compiler/schema) to validate the data.
2.  A reference [compiler](/docs/compiler) that implements the data format and
    schema validation.

This approach brings several key advantages:

- **Separation of Concerns**: You focus solely on the **content** of your
  resume. The compiler handles the **presentation**â€”layout, typography, and
  formatting.
- **Early Error Detection**: The compiler validates your resume against a
  predefined schema, catching errors instantly with clear, actionable
  feedback.
- **Consistency and Reliability**: By enforcing a standard structure, the
  compiler ensures your resume data is always consistent and ready for any
  template.

### See It in Action

For example, consider the following resume with several common errors:

```yml lineNumbers title="invalid-resume.yml"
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://yamlresume.dev/schema.json

  typography:
    fontSize: 13pt # [!code highlight]
```

We have several issues:

1. `email: hi@pp` - format is invalid
2. `url: https//ppresume.com/gallery` - protocol part is missing a `:`
3. `city: S` - too short, should be 2 characters or more, is there any city in the
world whose name is only 1 character?
4. `- D` - the first course is just too short, should be 2 characters or
more
5. `fontSize: 13pt` - should be 10pt, 11pt or 12pt, 13pt is just too large and make
little sense in resume drafting scenario

These errors, which might have gone unnoticed previously, are now caught
instantly. You can run `yamlresume validate my-resume.yml` or simply `yamlresume
build my-resume.yml`. YAMLResume will report all issues in the widely adopted
[clang-style error format](https://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html), allowing
you to fix them before the final PDF is generated.

## At the Heart of the Compiler: The Schema

The cornerstone of this new release is the **[YAMLResume
Schema](/docs/compiler/schema)**. We provide a comprehensive schema that
defines the structure and rules for every piece of data in your resume.

We use two powerful technologies for this:

- **[Zod](https://zod.dev)**: For runtime validation within the compiler,
  providing a robust safety net and detailed error messages.
- **[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org)**: For editor and IDE integration.
  By adding a single line to your YAML file, you unlock auto-completion,
  inline on-hover property documentation, and real-time format validation
  right in your editor.

If you have a resume created prior to v0.5, you can still take advantage of
schema validation. Just add the following line to your resume file and install
the [YAML Language
Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) for your
editor.

```yml lineNumbers
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://yamlresume.dev/schema.json
```

This integration provides a suite of benefits that dramatically improve the
resume writing experience:

### Auto-Completion

Spend less time looking up field names. Your editor will suggest valid
properties as you type, ensuring you use the correct fields every time.

### Real-time Format Validation

Catch errors as they happen. The schema validation provides instant feedback on
everything from simple typos to incorrect email formats or missing required
fields.

If a required key is missing, the warning is escalated to its parent object,
making it easy to spot and fix.

### Inline Property Documentation

No more guessing what a field does. Hover over any property to get instant
documentation explaining its purpose, expected format, and allowed values.

## The Enhanced CLI

The `yamlresume` [CLI](/docs/cli) is now more powerful than ever. The
[build](/docs/cli#build) command runs the entire compiler pipeline, from
validation to PDF generation, while the new [validate](/docs/cli#validate)
command lets you check your resume without building it.

This seamless workflow transforms your resume creation process, making it more
efficient and reliable while minimizing errors.
