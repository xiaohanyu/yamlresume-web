Every developer needs a resume unless you are a world-famous professional.
Writing a resume may not be hard, but it is definitely not fun and tedious. Many
spend days crafting their resumes, chasing after a 100% typo-free, grammar
checked resumes with professional layout and typesetting.

[YAMLResume](https://yamlresume.dev) allows you to create and version control
your resumes using [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and generate professional looking
PDFs with beautiful typesetting in a breeze.

It started as the core typesetting engine for [PPResume](https://ppresume.com)—a
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) based, commercial, pixel perfect resume
builder—which already helps thousands of people create beautifully typeset
resumes. Without too much hesitation, we decided to open source it so that
people can always have the right to say [no to vendor
lock-in](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/no-vendor-lock-in).

![YAMLResume New and Build Resume](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/yamlresume-new-and-build.webp)

## Quick Start

YAMLResume provides a [CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume),
besides, it has a mandatory dependency on a typesetting engine in order to
generate PDF. In other words, you should [install a typesetting
engine](/docs/installation#typesetting-engine) first if you want to generate
PDF.

Installing `yamlresume` CLI is a breeze. You can install it using your favourite
Node.js package manager:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```console tab="npm"
npm install -g yamlresume
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add -g yamlresume
```

```console tab="yarn"
yarn global add yamlresume
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add -g yamlresume
```
</Tabs>

Verify `yamlresume` is installed successfully:

```console
$ yamlresume help
Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

YAMLResume — Resume as Code in YAML

 __   __ _    __  __ _     ____
 \ \ / // \  |  \/  | |   |  _ \ ___  ___ _   _ ___  ___   ___
  \ V // _ \ | |\/| | |   | |_) / _ \/ __| | | / _ \/ _ \ / _ \
   | |/ ___ \| |  | | |___|  _ <  __/\__ \ |_| | | | | | |  __/
   |_/_/   \_\_|  |_|_____|_| \_\___||___/\____|_| |_| |_|\___|


Options:
  -V, --version   output the version number
  -v, --verbose   verbose output
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  new [filename]  create a new resume
  build <source>  build a resume to LaTeX and PDF
  languages       i18n and l10n support
  templates       manage resume templates
  help [command]  display help for command
```

We also recommend that you install [Linux
Libertine](http://yamlresume.dev/docs/getting-started#linux-libertine) font in
order to get the best looking PDFs.

Last but not least, if you want to create a CJK resume, we also recommend that
you  install [Google Noto fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) for [best
unicode coverage](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/63).

### Create a New Resume

You can create a new resume with a one-liner:

```console
$ yamlresume new my-resume.yml
✔ Created my-resume.yml successfully.
```

Under the hood `yamlresume new` would clone a sample resume from
[here](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/cli/resources/resume.yml).
Then you can get a PDF with a one-liner again:

```console
$ yamlresume build my-resume.yml
◐ Generating resume PDF with command: xelatex -halt-on-error my-resume.tex...
✔ Generated resume PDF successfully.
```

You are done! Check out the generated resume PDF:

![Resume Page 2](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/resume-2.webp)

You can check [PPResume Gallery](https://ppresume.com/gallery) for more examples
powered by YAMLResume as the typesetting engine.

### Troubleshooting

YAMLResume CLI provides a verbose flag `-v`/`--verbose` to show more detailed
logging information. If you have trouble building a resume, you can try to run
the commands again with this verbose flag and paste the output into [github
issues](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues), I will take a look and
get back to you.

## How Does It Work?

Under the hood, YAMLResume works like a mini compiler, i.e, it takes an input,
parses it to an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and
then generates an output.

The core design principle of YAMLResume is [separation of
concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). One of the most
famous examples that follows this principle is HTML & CSS, which are the
foundation of the modern web—HTML is used to organize the content in a webpage,
CSS is used to define the content presentation style.

Following the core principle, YAMLResume is designed based on the following
requirements:

- the resume content should be written in plain text, which is version control
  friendly
- the plain text should use a fully structured format, which gives us more
  control and flexibility
- YAML is better than JSON because it is more human-readable and human-writable
- the YAML plain text is then rendered into a PDF with a pluggable typesetting
  engine
- an opinionated layout should be provided out of the box, while still allowing
  people to adjust options accordingly like font sizes, page margins, etc.

## Why YAML?

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) is another project that allows people to
create resumes in a structured format. However, most developers would agree that
YAML is better than JSON with regard to human readability and writability. For
example, it is quite inconvenient to represent multi-line strings in JSON, while
YAML has native support for it.

Compare a resume snippet in JSON and YAML:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "basics": {
      "name": "Andy Dufresne",
      "headline": "Headed for the Pacific",
      "phone": "(213) 555-9876",
      "email": "hi@ppresume.com",
      "url": "https://ppresume.com/gallery",
      "summary": "- Computer Science major with strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software development\n- Pixel perfect full stack web developer, specialised in creating high-quality, visually appealing websites\n- Experiened in databases (SQL, NoSQL), familiar with server-side technologies (Node.js, Express, etc.)\n- Team player, with detail-oriented mindset and a keen eye for design and user experiences"
    }
  }
}
```

```yml
content:
  basics:
    name: Andy Dufresne
    headline: Headed for the Pacific
    phone: "(213) 555-9876"
    email: hi@ppresume.com
    url: https://ppresume.com/gallery
    summary: |
      - Computer Science major with strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software development
      - Pixel perfect full stack web developer, specialised in creating high-quality, visually appealing websites
      - Experiened in databases (SQL, NoSQL), familiar with server-side technologies (Node.js, Express, etc.)
      - Team player, with detail-oriented mindset and a keen eye for design and user experiences
```

Which one is more readable and writable? The answer is obvious.

JSON Resume has no concern about the layout of the resume. In the real world,
you can't just send a JSON file to recruiters right? The structured resume
format needs to be converted to a human-readable document format like docx, PDF,
etc.  YAMLResume offers an opinionated layout configuration, and guarantees
pixel perfect PDF output.

At the time of writing, YAMLResume's opinionated layout supports:

- locale languages
  - English
  - Simplified Chinese
  - Traditional Chinese
  - Spanish
- margins
  - top
  - left
  - right
  - bottom
- page numbers
- template
- typography
  - font size

Here is a sample code snippet for layout configuration in YAMLResume:

```yml
layout:
  locale:
    language: en
  margins:
    top: 2.5cm
    left: 1.5cm
    right: 1.5cm
    bottom: 2.5cm
  page:
    showPageNumbers: true
  template: moderncv-banking
  typography:
    fontSize: 11pt
```

## Why Not Markdown?

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a another popular choice
for writing resumes, there are also some resume builders that adopt markdown as
the main input format. However, markdown is a general-purpose markup language
for creating formatted text, while resumes only use a very limited set of
markdown features.

For example, the following markdown syntax are very unlikely to be used in a
resume:

- blockquote
- code block
- horizontal rules
- images
- tables
- html markup
- etc.

Second, markdown is far too flexible, often giving users more freedom than they
need to create a resume. It would be pretty hard to reliably parse a generic
markdown document as a resume.

Third, features like templates switching, precise layout control (like `\hfill`
and `\hspace` in LaTeX) is very hard to implement in markdown.

In conclusion, using a fully structured format such as YAML/JSON gives us more
control and reliability over formatting and layout for resumes.

## Why still LaTeX?

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a very mature and stable typesetting
engine that can produce extremely high-quality PDFs. However, many LaTeX users,
even LaTeX enthusiasts, would agree that the LaTeX language is somewhat
outdated—its error messages are often quite confusing, and the reliance on
global variables often leads to conflicts between packages, the compilation
speed is slow for large documents and often quite complicated, and it produces
ugly intermediate files (`.aux`, `.log`, etc.).

Some suggest to replace LaTeX with [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst),
which is a modern typesetting engine, with much better DX and much faster
compilation. However, after careful evaluation, I decided to stick with LaTeX.
The deal breaker here is that, YAMLResume is designed to support multi languages
with the best possible typesetting quality, however, typst [CJK
support](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/on-typesetting-engines#cjk-3) is still
unstable and lacking.

Later on I may add a new
[renderer](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/renderer/base.ts)
backend to support typst.

## Rich Text Support

Although we have decided not to use markdown as the resume input format, we do
support a limited set of markdown rich text syntax for the `summary` field in
various sections.

For now, we support the following markdown syntax:

- `**bold**`
- `*italic*`
- `[link](https://www.google.com)`
- ordered list
- unordered list
- nested list
- paragraphs

For example, this is a sample snippet for the `content.basics.summary` field:

```yml
---
content:
  basics:
    # ...
    summary: |
      This is a sample YAML resume that support limited set of markdown rich text syntax (bold, italics, links, lists):

      - Computer Science major with **strong foundation** in data structures, *algorithms*, and software development
        1. Pixel perfect full stack web developer, specialised in creating high-quality, visually appealing websites
        2. Experiened in databases (SQL, NoSQL), familiar with server-side technologies ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), Express, etc.)
      - Team player, with detail-oriented mindset and a keen eye for design and user experiences
```

And this is the generated PDF:

![Rich Text Support in Summary Field](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/rich-text-support-in-summary-field.webp)

You can see that the rich text syntax is rendered correctly with bold, italics,
links, lists, pretty solid, right?

## Roadmap

Overall the project is still in a very early stage, we have a long way to go.
I've already planned a list of features to do in the near future:

1. more languages, Japanese, Germany, French, etc
2. more templates
3. [section alias](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/11)
4. [section reordering](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/12)
5. [schema validation](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/10)

For any trouble, you can:

- raise an [issue](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/)
- open a [discussion](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/discussions)
