YAMLResume has achieved a significant milestone—500 stars on GitHub in just
about a month.

In the meantime, we received our first [pull

request](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/pull/19), and addressed our
first [bug report](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/13). Special
thanks to [@jizusun](https://github.com/jizusun),

## Why Open Source?

The first line of code for YAMLResume was actually written in 2023. It began as
 the core typesetting engine for [PPResume](https://ppresume.com)—a
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)-based, commercial, pixel-perfect resume
builder that has already helped thousands of people create beautifully typeset
resumes.

While I am not ready to open source PPResume itself, I do want to give users
full control over their resumes. In December 2024, PPResume enabled users to
download the generated LaTeX code for their resumes, ensuring our [no vendor
lock-in](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/no-vendor-lock-in) promise and giving
users complete ownership of their data.

Moreover, the development of PPResume has greatly benefited from the open source
community. I have learned a lot from it myself, and now it is time to give back.

There are very few open source tools that use YAML as a resume format. [JSON
Resume](https://jsonresume.org) is a good try—as we all know, YAML is a superset
of JSON. However, JSON Resume does not provide an opinionated solution for
resume typesetting, layout, or output, making it far less practical. YAML, on
the other hand, is a [much better choice than
JSON](/docs/comparisons#json-resume) for resume formatting.

Open sourcing YAMLResume was clearly the right decision. Check out the download
trends for YAMLResume on NPM:

## What's Next?

Although YAMLResume has been used by a commercial resume builder for almost two
years, it is still in the early stages of development, and there is much more to
be done.

[Docker support](./yamlresume-docker) was one of the most requested features,
and I am pleased to say it is now [available](/docs/installation#docker-users).

Another important feature is data validation. Unlike PPResume, which provides a
carefully crafted and designed form for users to fill out and validate their
resume data, YAMLResume accepts unconstrained input—any `.yaml` file. We must
provide a way to [validate
input](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/10) to ensure the program
handles all forms of input gracefully.

Feature-wise, we plan to support [section
aliases](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/11) and [section
reordering](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/12), making the PDF
output more adaptable and flexible.

For developer experience, we aim to [support a `dev`
sub-command](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/25) so users can
modify resumes and see PDF changes in near real time.

Finally, some users have raised concerns about ATS compatibility. We are
committed to ensuring that the PDF output is [ATS
compatible](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/23).

Stay tuned!
