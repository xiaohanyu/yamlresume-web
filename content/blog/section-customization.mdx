YAMLResume [v0.6](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
is here, and it brings two powerful features for customizing your resume's
structure: [section aliases](/docs/layout/sections/aliases) and [section
reorder](/docs/layout/sections/reorder). These features allow you to rename
section titles and control their sequence in the final PDF, giving you greater
flexibility to tailor your resume.

Let's dive into how they work.

## Section Aliases

The default section titles in YAMLResume (e.g., `education`, `work`) are
automatically [translated](/docs/layout/sections/docs/content/multi-languages)
based on your chosen [locale language](/docs/layout#locale). However, you might
prefer a different title. For instance, you might want to change "Work" to
"Professional Experience" for the `work` section.

To define aliases, use the `layout.sections.aliases` map in your `resume.yml`.

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

layout:                               # [!code focus]
  sections:                           # [!code focus]
    aliases:                          # [!code focus]
      work: Professional Experience   # [!code focus]
      education: Academic Background  # [!code focus]
      skills: Technical Skills        # [!code focus]
```


## Section Reordering

By default, sections are rendered in a [standard
order](/docs/layout/sections/reorder#default-section-order). The
`layout.sections.order` feature lets you change this sequence to highlight your
most important information first.

For example, to place your "Skills" and "Projects" sections before your "Work"
experience, you can define the order like this:

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

layout:           #[!code focus]
  sections:       #[!code focus]
    order:        #[!code focus]
      - skills    #[!code focus]
      - projects  #[!code focus]
      - work      #[!code focus]
```

Sections in the `order` list will appear first, followed by the remaining
sections in their default order.

## Putting It All Together: A Complete Example

Let's create a one-page resume that uses both features. We will alias and
reorder some sections at the same time.

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://yamlresume.dev/schema.json

---

layout:
  sections:                          # [!code highlight]
    aliases:                         # [!code highlight]
      work: Professional Experience  # [!code highlight]
      education: Academic Background # [!code highlight]
      skills: Technical Skills       # [!code highlight]
    order:                           # [!code highlight]
      - basics                       # [!code highlight]
      - work                         # [!code highlight]
      - education                    # [!code highlight]
      - skills                       # [!code highlight]

Here we alias the `work`, `education`, and `skills` sections, and reorder the
sections by assigning higher priority to `work` than `education`, followed by
the `skills` section:

Now, let's build the resume:

```bash
yamlresume build resume.yml
```

You will get a PDF file with the following contentâ€”I highlighted the sections
with customizations:

Great, it works as expected! Isn't this cool?

## In Summary

With section aliases and reordering, you now have fine-grained control over your
resume's structure. We hope these features help you create even more
personalized and effective resumes.

The best part of section customization is that you can always extend [YAMLResume's
i18n capabilities to support more
languages](/docs/layout/sections/reorder#default-section-order) on your own. By
default, the default section titles will be translated to the target locale
language (set via `layout.locale.language`) automatically. However, there are
always cases where YAMLResume [hasn't supported your target language
yet](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/discussions/36), so you can
override the default section titles with your own.

Meanwhile, people with different backgrounds have different preferences for the
section order. For example, candidates looking for an industry job may order
`work` in front of `education`, while postdoc researchers looking for an
academic position would order `education` in front of `work`.

Hope you enjoy these new features!
