## Introduction

Creating a resume may not be difficult, but it is definitely a boring, lengthy
and tedious process.

With YAMLResume, you can create and version control your resumes with YAML and
create pixel perfect PDFs with professional layout and typesetting in a breeze.

YAMLResume is the core engine of [PPResume](https://ppresume.com), a LaTeX based
builder. It has helped [thousands of
people](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/2024-recap) around the world create
pixel perfect, professional looking resumes and land their dream jobs. Here we
decided to open source the engine, in order to give people the right and freedom
to say [no to vendor lock-in](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/no-vendor-lock-in)

![YAMLResume New and Build Resume](./static/images/yamlresume-new-and-build.webp)

## Getting Started

Let's assume that you're using macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as the
package manager. If you are not, please see the
[Installation](/docs/installation) guide for detailed instructions for your
operating system.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Install Node.js

You need to [install
Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all#macos) 20.x or
newer.

```console
$ brew install node
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Install Typesetting Engine

YAMLResume needs a [typesetting
engine](/docs/getting-started#typesetting-engine) to generate PDF. Currently it
supports two typesetting engines:

- [XeTeX](/docs/getting-started#xetex)
- [Tectonic](/docs/getting-started#tectonic)

<Tabs groupId="typesetting-engine" persist items={["XeTeX", "Tectonic"]}>
```sh tab="XeTeX"
brew install mactex
```

```sh tab="Tectonic"
brew install tectonic
```
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step>
### Install YAMLResume

Installing `yamlresume` is a breeze. You can install it using your favourite
Node.js package manager:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```sh tab="npm"
npm install -g yamlresume
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm add -g yamlresume
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn global add yamlresume
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add -g yamlresume
```
</Tabs>

Verify `yamlresume` is installed successfully:

```console
$ yamlresume help
Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

YAMLResume — Resume as Code in YAML

 __   __ _    __  __ _     ____
 \ \ / // \  |  \/  | |   |  _ \ ___  ___ _   _ ___  ___   ___
  \ V // _ \ | |\/| | |   | |_) / _ \/ __| | | / _ \/ _ \ / _ \
   | |/ ___ \| |  | | |___|  _ <  __/\__ \ |_| | | | | | |  __/
   |_/_/   \_\_|  |_|_____|_| \_\___||___/\____|_| |_| |_|\___|


Options:
  -V, --version   output the version number
  -v, --verbose   verbose output
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  new [filename]  create a new resume
  build <source>  build a resume to LaTeX and PDF
  languages       i18n and l10n support
  templates       manage resume templates
  help [command]  display help for command
```
</Step>

<Step>
### [Optional] Install Fonts

#### Linux Libertine Font

We also recommend installing the [Linux
Libertine font](/docs/getting-started#linux-libertine) for the best looking PDF
output, but this is optional.

```sh
brew install font-linux-libertine
```

#### Noto Fonts

If you need to create a CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) resume, we recommend
that you install the [Noto font](https://fonts.google.com/noto):

```sh
brew install font-noto-sans-cjk font-noto-serif-cjk
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Create Your First YAML Resume

OK, we have everything ready, we can now create a yaml resume now with
`yamlresume new`:

```console
$ yamlresume new
✔ Created resume.yml successfully.
```

Edit `resume.yml` accordingly, then you can generate a PDF with `yamlresume
build`:

```console
$ yamlresume build resume.yml
◐ Generating resume PDF with command: xelatex -halt-on-error resume.tex...
✔ Generated resume PDF successfully.
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Sample Resume

Here is the complete YAML code for a two-page sample resume, tailored for a
[software
engineer](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/cli/resources/resume.yml):
