## JSON Resume

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) is a pioneer in building a open standard
for a structured data format for resumes. Its first [official
release](https://jsonresume.org/blog/first-official-release) was in July 31,
2014, which is more than 10 years ago.

From its official website:

```markdown
## Origins and Conceptualization

JSON Resume was conceived as a solution to the fragmented and inconsistent
landscape of resume formats. Traditional resumes, typically created in formats
like Microsoft Word or PDF, often suffer from compatibility issues when parsed
by different systems. Recognizing this problem, Thomas Davis and Roland Sharp
initiated JSON Resume as an open-source project to create a universal,
machine-readable format for resumes.

## Development Milestones

The project began gaining momentum in the early 2010s, with significant
milestones such as the creation of the JSON Resume schema, the development of
the first CLI tools, and the establishment of the JSON Resume registry. These
milestones were driven by community contributions and the growing recognition of
the need for a standardized resume format in the tech industry.

JSON Resume did an excellent job in building a open standard for a structured
data format for resumes. However, it lacks some features that YAMLResume has.

YAMLResume is highly inspired by [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/), and
more opinionated in some aspects. For example, JSON Resumes says nothing about
how to convert the machine readable data to a beautiful, human-readable resume.

Here are some notable differences:

| Feature            | YAMLResume            | JSON Resume         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Data Format        | YAML                  | JSON                |
| Data Structure     | All top-level objects | Some nested objects |
| Typesetting Engine | LaTeX                 | None                |
| Layout Spec        | Built-in              | Not specified       |
| Rich Text Support  | Yes                   | No                  |

We are going to offer a tool to import JSON Resume to YAMLResume in the future.
