YAMLResume is a Node.js tool, under the hood, it transform your resumes from the
YAML format to LaTeX code and then call a LaTeX typesetting engine to compile
the generated LaTeX code to PDF. Besides, to get optimal PDF output, we also
suggest to install some fonts. In a nutshell, you need to install the followings
to get started with YAMLResume:

- Node.js
- [yamlresume package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume)
- a typesetting engine
- [optional] some fonts

Please follow the appropriate instructions below to install the necessary tools
based on your operating system. At the time of writing, our guide covers MacOS,
Windows, and some Linux distributions.

## Node.js

Node.js 20.x or newer is required.

There may be like 100+ methods to install Node.js on different OS, you can check
the official [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to get started.

We recommend using a [package
manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all) to install Node.js.

## yamlresume

Installing `yamlresume` is a breeze. You can install it using your favourite
Node.js package manager:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```console tab="npm"
npm install -g yamlresume
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add -g yamlresume
```

```console tab="yarn"
yarn global add yamlresume
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add -g yamlresume
```
</Tabs>

Verify that `yamlresume` is installed successfully:

```console
$ yamlresume help
Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

Options:

  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  new [filename]  create a new resume
  build <source>  build a resume to LaTeX and PDF
  languages       i18n and l10n support
  templates       manage resume templates
  help [command]  display help for command
```

If you just want to give `yamlresume` a try without installing it, you can use
`npx`, `pnpx` or other similar tools:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npx', 'pnpx', 'bun']}>
```console tab="npx"
npx yamlresume help
```

```console tab="pnpx"
pnpx yamlresume help
```

```console tab="bun"
bun exec yamlresume help
```
</Tabs>

## Typesetting Engine

Under the hood, `yamlresume` does the job of a compiler, parsing a YAML resume
to an
[AST](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/ast.ts)
and then [transforming the AST to LaTeX
code](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/codegen/latex.ts).

As a mini-compiler, `yamlresume` relies on a typesetting engine to compile the
generated LaTeX code to PDFs. Therefore you must first install a typesetting
engine first before you can use `yamlresume` to generate resume PDFs.

YAMLResume currently supports two typesetting engines: [XeTeX](#xetex) and
[Tectonic](#tectonic).

<Callout title="Why LaTeX?">
  At the time of writing, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is still the
  best choice of typesetting engine for producing professional looking PDFs.
  [Typst](https://typst.app/) is a great alternative, but it is still in its
  early stage and its CJK support is not mature and production ready yet.
  Previously I wrote a post [On Typesetting
  Engines](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/on-typesetting-engines) explaining
  the reasons why I chose LaTeX over other typesetting engines when I founded
  [PPResume](https://ppresume.com).
</Callout>

### XeTeX

[XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) is a [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
typesetting engine using [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) and
supporting modern font technologies such as
[OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType),
[Graphite](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/graphite) and [Apple Advanced
Typography (AAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Typography).

It is a very mature, stable typesetting engine that is widely used by many
academic and scientific people.

<Tabs groupId='os' persist items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
<Tab value="macOS">
The easiest way is to install the **MacTeX** distribution.

It includes XeTeX along with many other TeX-related programs and packages. You
can download it from the [MacTeX website](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) or
install it via homebrew:

```sh
brew install mactex
```
</Tab>

<Tab value='Windows'>
[MiKTeX distribution](https://miktex.org) is a popular choice for Windows and
includes XeTeX. You can download it from the [MiKTeX
website](https://miktex.org/download).

Alternatively, you can install **TeX Live** for Windows, which also includes
XeTeX. Download it from the [TeX Live
website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html).
</Tab>

<Tab value="Linux">
Most Linux distributions offer TeX Live through their package managers. XeTeX is
typically included in the `texlive-xetex` package or a larger `texlive-full`
meta-package.

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-xetex

# Or for a full installation, which would occupy more disk space though sudo apt
# install texlive-full
```

Alternatively, you can install TeX Live directly from the [TeX Live
website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) using their
installer, which works across different Linux distributions.

Verify that XeTeX is installed successfully:

```console
$ xetex -v

### Tectonic

[Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io) is a modernized, complete,
self-contained
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
engine, powered by [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) and
[TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

A full TeX Live distribution typically takes up several GB of disk space, while
tectonic's initial installation takes up only 10+ MB. It automatically downloads
support files, so you don't have to install a complete LaTeX distribution. When
you start using a new LaTeX package, Tectonic simply downloads the files it
needs and continues processing.

Tectonic provides an official [installation
guide](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/install.html), but this
would just put tectonic in the directory where you ran the installation command,
`yamlresume` needs a global `tectonic` command in your `$PATH`, so you need to
figure that out with some shell hacks on your own.

If you're a macOS user, you're in luck because Homebrew provides prebuilt
package:

```sh
brew install tectonic
```

In to my experience, tectonic still has some minor compatibility issues with
official XeTeX, so if you do not mind the long download tim eof a full TeX Live
distribution, XeTeX is still the recommended choice here.

## Font

### Linux Libertine

YAMLResume adopts [Linux Libertine](https://www.dafont.com/linux-libertine.font)
as the default font for Latin characters. It is highly recommended to install it
in order to get an optimal PDF output.

<Tabs groupId='font-os' persist items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
<Tab value="macOS">
For Homebrew users:

```sh
brew install font-linux-libertine
```

Otherwise you can download the latest version of [Linux
Libertine](https://www.dafont.com/linux-libertine.font) from the website and
install the font with macOS's [Font
Book](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/font-book/fntbk1000/mac).
</Tab>

<Tab value="Windows">
Download the latest version of [Linux
Libertine](https://www.dafont.com/linux-libertine.font) from the website and
extract the archive and install the font.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Linux">
For Debian/Ubuntu users:

```sh
sudo apt install fonts-linuxlibertine
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Google Noto

If you need CJK resumes, you will also need to install [Google Noto
fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) for [best unicode
coverage](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/63).

<Tabs groupId='os' persist items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>

<Tab value='macOS'>
For Homebrew users:

```sh
brew install font-noto-sans-cjk font-noto-serif-cjk
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Windows">
Download Noto fonts and follow the [official
guide](https://fonts.google.com/noto/use#use-noto-fonts) to install on Windows.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Linux">
For Debian/Ubuntu users:

```sh
sudo apt install fonts-noto-cjk fonts-noto-cjk-extra
```

## Troubleshooting

You can [raise an issue](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/new) if
you have trouble to install `yamlresume` or its dependencies.

### Getting Tired?

If you are getting tired of the installation process, you can try
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com), which is a hosted, commercial resume builder
solution who open sourced YAMLResume.
